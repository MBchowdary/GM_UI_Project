# GM_UI_Project
This project contains source code to retrieve data  from last fm, show it on a recycler view and then preserve data on state changes. 


1. Used two different layouts for Landscape and potrait modes
2. User will be able to see the app in Land scape mode only when the screen size is large i.e on tablet 
3. Used navigation component in portait mode, and it provided with a argument for fragment communication 
4. For landscape mode I added two fragments to same activity and used interface to coommunicate
5. Used retrofit to consume lastFm api data
6. Used recycler view to show data
